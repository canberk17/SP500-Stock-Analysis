# SP500-Stock-Analysis
Analyzing stocks with technical indicators and predicting future movements can be time-consuming. My plan is to write an algorithm that does the analysis efficiently and fast. To do that I will calculate technical indicators from historical stock data and use machine learning to predict the future price of the stocks and the important features of my model. To do that  I will get data out from the internet(**Yahoo, Iex** ) into pandas Furthermore I will be evaluating the performance of the models by creating train and test groups in order to optimize them. I will be using Simple Moving Averages, Exponentially Weighted Average, and Bollinger Bands buy and sell a stock once they all send a signal. I will be analyzing the performance of the stocks and their correlations with each other as well. I will be backtesting the algorithm rather than applying to current data available and visualize the total returns.

# SP500-Stock-Analysis
Manually analyzing stocks with technical indicators and predicting future movements can be time-consuming. Therefore, I plan to write an algorithm that does analyze the stock trends efficiently and fast. To do that I will implement technical indicators based on historical stock data and use machine learning to predict the future price of the stocks and the important features of my model. I will use Yahoo/Iex to gather stock prices into a pandas data frame. Specifically, I will be using Simple Moving Averages, Exponentially Weighted Average, and Bollinger Bands to buy and sell stocks once they all send a signal the same trend. I will be analyzing the performance of the stocks and their correlations with each other as well. Lastly, I will backtest my algorithm with 100K  to see the returns to my portfolio and visualize them.

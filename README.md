# S&P500-Stock-Analysis
**Manually analyzing stocks with technical indicators and predicting future movements can be time-consuming. Therefore, I plan to write an algorithm that analyzes the stock trends efficiently and fast**. 
To do that I will implement technical indicators based on historical stock data and use machine learning to predict the future price of the stocks and the important features of my model. I will use Yahoo/Iex to gather stock prices into a pandas data frame. 

 Technical Indicators:
- Simple Moving Averages, 
- Exponentially Weighted Average,
- Bollinger Bands 
 Once all of them signal the same trend the algorithm will execute buy/sell orders. 

I will be analyzing the performance of the stocks and their correlations with each other as well. Lastly, I will backtest my algorithm with 100K  to see the returns to my portfolio and visualize them.
